# Replication Exercise of "Gender Differences in the Choice of Major: The Importance of Female Role Models"



Here are the STATA codes of the replication exercise of the excelent paper "Gender Differences in the Choice of Major:The Importance of Female Role Models" by Catherine Porter and Danila Serra. 

The codes generate all the tables, in LaTeX, and almost all the figures in the published paper. To run all the codes, just run the 0_master.do and it should reproduce all the desired tables and figures.

## Technical Notes

- The data is not included in this repository. However, members of the AEA can access the data set on the Additional Materials [here](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20180426).
- All regresion p values and confidence intervals are different from the paper because I used another random seed.
- Figures's style and colors were created with STATA's graph recorder. The instructions on how to "install" the recording inside the master code and in each figure do file. The project's recordings are available in the "graph_recordings" folder.
- Figure 4 could not be replicated because there is no data available on the 2014 classes in the AEA's data set.

## Personal analysis

To add value to the paper and the replication exercise, I will explore if there is a subsample male students who were encouraged by the role models. The analysis can be found in this [pdf](https://jjgecon.github.io/assets/resources/Porter_Serra_rep_add_a.pdf).
